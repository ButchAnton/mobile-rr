# ESP8266 Mobile Rick Roll Captive Portal
- User connects thinking it is a free WiFi access point
- After accepting Terms of Service they are Rick Roll'd

To access the console, connect to the ESP8266 Access Point and browse to "http://10.10.10.1/console".
From here you can monitor all connections and see when someone gets Rick Roll'd by the device.

The purpose of this project was to help me get familiar with programming for the ESP8266.
I learned a lot from other projects to get this working the way I had envisioned.
I provided links to all of the projects that I borrowed from in the comments at the top of the .INO file.

I still need to make a video to demo this project and I want to add a few more features.
It is fully functional now though. Let me know what you think.
